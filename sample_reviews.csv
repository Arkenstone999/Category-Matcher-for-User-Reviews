2022-01-23 22:10:00;a5f5b9f8-9dda-45b6-aaa8-2cee21fb8034;I visited Super Sandwiches last weekend and was absolutely blown away by the variety of sandwiches they had to offer. The bread was freshly baked, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, and it was a delight from the first bite to the last. The pesto sauce was rich and flavorful, complementing the perfectly grilled chicken. I could tell that a lot of thought went into balancing the flavors. I paired it with their fresh lemonade, which was a perfect combination for a sunny day. Highly recommend this place for anyone who loves gourmet sandwiches.
2022-01-28 04:35:00;00af3577-ca15-4a7f-a674-22199799d724;I decided to give Super Sandwiches a try after hearing so much hype, but I was slightly disappointed. While the sandwich was decent, the service left much to be desired. I ordered a turkey and cheese sandwich with avocado and had to wait almost 30 minutes despite the shop not being busy. When I finally got my order, the sandwich was lukewarm, and the avocado seemed overripe. The flavors didn't blend as well as I had hoped, and I found myself wishing I had gone elsewhere. I hope this was just a one-off bad experience, but for now, I can't say I’ll rush back.

The attention to detail at Super Sandwiches is evident from the moment you walk in. The decor is simple yet inviting, and the aroma of freshly made sandwiches fills the air. I went with a group of friends, and we ordered a variety of items to share. Each sandwich was crafted beautifully, with premium-quality ingredients that stood out in every bite. The standout for me was the beef brisket sandwich—it was tender, juicy, and packed with flavor. The side salad was also fresh and crisp. Kudos to the team for delivering an exceptional experience.

My personal favorite is the veggie delight sandwich, packed with grilled vegetables, feta cheese, and a hint of balsamic glaze that ties everything together beautifully. What I appreciate the most is their commitment to using fresh and locally sourced ingredients. The staff is always friendly, and the service is quick, making it ideal for a quick bite during the workday. I’ve introduced several colleagues to this place, and they’ve all become fans too. Keep up the great work!
